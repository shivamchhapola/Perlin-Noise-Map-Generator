# Map and Island Generation using perlin noise

I was making a game in unity and started searching for ways to generate terrain when I found out about Perlin Noise and I followed along the tutorial of Sebastian League about this topic and I wanted to learn more about Perlin noise and ways to Implement it and thus I created these scripts. This is probably not the best way to do it but my smol brain could only handle this much, there're more efficient and in generally better ways to do it.

## How to use?

- Install numpy, matplotlib, noise

- Run PerlinMapGenerator.py

- You can change width, height and other values(Look at the comments on the script for more information)
